FBI Clicky Game

What is this?
This is a simple memorization and click game. The object of the game is to click on only one of the FBI agents once. If you repeat guesses, you lose and the score is reset to 0. You win by reaching the max score total of 15.

How to Play:
Open the app/game: https://avalonmtg.github.io/clicky-game/
Click on any of the agent tiles you desire
The tiles will all reshuffle themselves
Click on another character, but you can only click on a character once.
Keep going to see if you can get all 15! Then you outsmarted the FBI!
